## About Me
I am a full stack software developer with an eclectic background in development, maintain, QA, and customer service, which gives me a unique perspective to bringing humanity to tech, and tech to communities. I am not afraid of hard work or challenging myself and stepping outside my comfort zone while working with others to achieve a common goal. I take an efficient approach when it comes to coding, by breaking up jobs into smaller, more manageable sizes. I am very coachable, always willing to listen to othersâ€™ ideas and will work together to find a solution that makes the most sense for the need.
